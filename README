Classes

Things needed:

Superclass of all types of L-Systems
	Individual types of L-Systems

Species implementing L-Systems
Species implementing models


Productions
	Signal descriptions
		Signal description builder

Graphics and UI
 Plant a seed
 Advance a step
 Reverse a step
 Use a seed so steps back and forward are consistent
 / Move a branch, bind branches --> these operations would occur on the model word
 / Then translates the model word to models
