* L-Ruby
* 
*  The Ruby-Processing library for generating plant models
*  driven by Lindenmayer Systems (L-Systems)

Classes

Things needed:

Superclass of all types of L-Systems
	Individual types of L-Systems

Species implementing L-Systems
Species implementing models

Productions
	Signal descriptions
		Signal description builder

Graphics and UI
 Plant a seed
 Advance a step
 Reverse a step
 Use a seed so steps back and forward are consistent
 / Move a branch, bind branches --> these operations would occur on the model word
 / Then translates the model word to models


MILESTONES

Generate a production word from an axiom and a set of productions, n steps.
	REACHED: 18 July 2012 2:28 am

Generate a bracketed (to be branched) production word from an axiom and a set of productions, n steps.
	REACHED: 18 July 2012 2:28 am (same program, brackets don't make a difference in rewriting yet)

Display a 2D model based on a word.
	REACHED: 18 July 2012 11:55 am (only rotates in one direction),
	UPDATE:  18 July 2012 12:18 pm (rotates in multiple directions)

Display a 3D model based on a word.
	REACHED: 18 July 13:45 pm (not looking great yet but it does produce 3D)

Generate a stochastic system
	REACHED: 

Generate a stochastic system that produces deterministic results given a seed
	REACHED:

Build a productions builder, that creates a set of productions from values selected from a web form
	REACHED:

Generate a production word every class of general l-system from axiom, productions, steps, angle
	REACHED:

Build a productions database that uses plant data as a basis for the model, and cross-checks generated models against experimental data.
